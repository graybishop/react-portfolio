      <h2 className="text-3xl">About Me</h2>
      <div>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been tinkering with computers, web sites, scripts, and the windows platform for over a decade both professionally, and on my own time. I like learning and teaching new technology, which has led me to pick up a new hobby or two every year. In my previous job, I was in charge of office tech infrastructure, deployment and maintenance of an IoT fleet, and data analysis. Having a large domain of knowledge allowed me the agility to pick up slack across departments.   Iâ€™m building a web dev portfolio to crystalize my skill-set and create a formal career.  </p>
        <p>I'm currently into 3D printingðŸ–¨, 3D modeling ðŸš§, PC gaming ðŸ–±, light woodworking ðŸª“, and fantasy novelsðŸ“–. Some of those hobbies synergize better than others, but all originate from a skill I had an interest in learning about (CAD, Part Design, Abstraction, Manufacturing, and Story-Telling). After being with my last company for three years, and wearing ten hats, Iâ€™ve decided now is a great time to start putting emphasis on the things I like to do, and getting paid for it. </p>
