# React Portfolio

## Description

My portfolio rebuilt with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), 'A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.' React makes it easy to build reusable parts (or 'components') that can be implemented throughout the app, allowing me to build and style one piece of the app at a time before pulling them all together. I needed a place to share my projects and generate leads while i'm looking for work, and building this portfolio out with React (in addition to [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)), let me easily create a responsive portfolio.
